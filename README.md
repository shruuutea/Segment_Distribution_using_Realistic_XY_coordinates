# Segment Distribution using Realistic XY Coordinates

This C++ script processes segment distributions using realistic XY coordinates.  
It is designed for analyzing GEM detector data, ensuring accurate spatial mapping.  

## Features
- Reads input XY data from detectors.
- Applies transformation to obtain realistic coordinates.
- Visualizes segment distribution for GEM modules used in 2nd station of CBM experiment at FAIR.  

## Usage
Run the script using ROOT:
```bash
root Segment_Distribution_using_Realistic_XY_coordinates.C
